DailyCodingProblem
==================

A service called [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) sends, well, a coding problem... every day. Here are my solutions to a lot of them, all written in python (v3).

The date folders are not significant because the problems sent to each subscriber differ based on when you first signed up.

My solutions are very likely not the most efficient or shortest solutions possible, and sometimes I ignore the constant space/time constraints (but I try not to). I usually try to solve them as fast as I can (like in an interview), sometimes in a "brute-force"-ish way, but sometimes I'll think of a different design and write a better second method (like in the 05-15-2018 problem).

I'm not a programming god. You can probably write a better solution. Also, I won't upload any solutions I find online; this is my own work.
